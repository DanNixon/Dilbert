# Contributing

- New "apps" should be added as examples in the library (`library/examples/`)
- Keep pull requests limited to a single thing (fixing an issue in an existing
  app, adding a new app, or fixing an issue in the library)
- If modifying the library compile and flash the `HardwareDemo` example to
  ensure things still work
